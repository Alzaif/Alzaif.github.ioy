The actual text on `Construction` says this:

```yaml
Primary: |
  * Place 1 PDS or 1 Space Dock on a planet you control.
  * Place 1 PDS on a planet you control.

Secondary: |
  Spend 1 token from your strategy pool and place it in any system;
  you may place either 1 space dock or 1 PDS on a planet you control in that system
```

But, we effectively play it like this:

```yaml
Primary: |
  * Place 1 PDS or 1 Space Dock on a planet you control.
  * Place 1 PDS on a planet you control.

Secondary: |
  Spend 1 token from your strategy pool;
  you may place either 1 space dock or 1 PDS on a planet you control in any system
  you control.
```

The consequences of this mean that a system is not locked down as a result of interacting with the Secondary of `Construction`.
